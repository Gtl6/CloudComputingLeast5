# CloudComputingLeast5

Attached are, as per the instructions, the 3 data files I used, a screen shot of the resultant output (and the output file itself downloaded from GCP) and a screenshot of my cloud accound, along with all of the relevant code, as well as the script I used to create my data from a dictionary text file you can find at this link: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt

Thanks!
